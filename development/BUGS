GNU dr -- `BUGS' starts here.

Bugs:

  This release of GNU dr (version 1.0) is almost stable.
  Some bugs surely remain.

  Please include enough information for the maintainers
  in order to reproduce the problem. Generally speaking,
  that means:

    - the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the
      bug and command line invocations of the program(s) involved.

    - a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
    - the version number of the program(s) involved (use -v).
    - hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
    - anything else that you think would be helpful.

  See also the file `TODO'.
